# Helper bot for codeforces contests

### This script automatically extracts the sample test cases of a given codeforces contest, creates sparate files for inputs and outputs and organizes them in saperate folder of each problem.

You can also provide your own template file and the script will create a solution file based on the template file for each question in the contest.

This script works on both windows and linux

All sample test cases can be automatically checked using *runtests.py*
